Bootcamp JavaScript Week 4 Challenge 
I found this challenge to be quite difficult. I already had some prior Python experience which was helpful with the basics, but it took me a while to figure out how to iterate through the array to focus on only the values and not the string elements. The purpose of this task was to strengthen my base knowledge of Javascript, specifically focusing on arrays and for loops. I also gained a bit more insight into how to display my outputs in the browser, speficically making use of the "\n" line break method to write multiple outputs on one alert() command, this was quite easy to implement as it's the same as in Python. The greatest challenge I faced with this taks was getting used to the syntax, as I would often forget which type of parentheses I was meant to be using, though I imagine this will get easier with more practice. This challenge is dated 16th January 2023. The link to the website where you can view the output is:
